- For all of you guys which just want to use the GUI. only download the .zip
- Add the libary PID_v1_own to your libary directory
- Flash Arduino 1.8 on your Arduino pending on your application you have to manipulate values here
- Run the program in the folder Arduino_Save_Receive_v2\Arduino_Save_Receive_v2\bin\Debug\Arduino_Save_Receive_v2
  Do not seperate the Datas in the folder! !!!!The GUI can not work without the needed libarys!!!!!
- Read the manual!

I just made minor changements on your Library to work correctly with the GUI. The Changements do not 
affect the PID algorithm.
